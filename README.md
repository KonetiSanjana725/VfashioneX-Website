</strong><br/>
  <em>A revolutionary AI-powered fashion assistant for street-to-doorstep outfit discovery.

</em>

## 📖 Project Description
✨ **Problem Statement:** 
1.Finding the exact outfit you like is challenging:

2.Street style inspiration or online images often have no direct shopping link.

3.Existing platforms rarely allow instant customization before purchase.

4.Users face difficulty in getting outfits tailored to their preferences and measurements.

 
💡 **Proposed Solution:** VFashionX uses AI to:

1. Identify outfit type and name from uploaded images or sketches (e.g., corset, bodycon dress).


2. Provide working shopping links from platforms like Amazon, Myntra, H&M, Zara, and Flipkart.


3. Enable AI customization — change color, sleeves, neckline, shape, and fabric.


4. Show price in Indian Rupees for the customized outfit.


5. Facilitate secure order placement with address, delivery slot, mobile verification via OTP, payment, and confirmation.
   

6. Allow order tracking in real-time.

 
🎯 **Target Users / Use Cases:** 
1.Fashion enthusiasts seeking street-style outfits.

2.Users who want personalized clothing before buying.

3.Shoppers looking for quick AI-based style discovery.
